This algorithm is not guaranteed to find the correct genome. In the human genome, we know that there are often long sequences of repeated nucleotides. If our value of $k$ was not large enough to span these regions, we could produce reads from these regions that are identical. Our algorithm would then greedily merge these reads into one $k$-mer, even though the real genome has multiple repetitions of this $k$-mer. Therefore, our algorithm is not guaranteed to produce the most likely target genome."
