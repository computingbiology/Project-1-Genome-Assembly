    "We can define the _correct genome_ in this context as the genome which is most likely encoded in the DNA of the organism that is being sequenced. This algorithm is not guaranteed to find the correct genome. In the human genome, we know that there are often long sequences of repeated nucleotides. If our value of $k$ was not large enough to span these regions, we could produce reads from these regions that are identical. Our algorithm would then greedily merge these reads into one $k$-mer, even though the real genome has multiple repetitions of this $k$-mer. Therefore, our algorithm is not guaranteed to produce the most likely target genome."
